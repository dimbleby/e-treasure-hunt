  <p>I'm afraid there's nothing here - at least, not at the moment.</p>

    Sometimes things turn up in the strangest places, so don't assume that just
    because you've looked here, you shouldn't ever try that again. But if you do
    need to come back, I'm sure there'll be a clue pointing to this location.
  </p>
  <p>For now, you should probably go back...</p>
