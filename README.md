**IMPORTANT - PLEASE NOTE**

**It is your responsibility to ensure that any accounts and credentials used by
this app are set up with adequate security measures and usage caps, such that if
they are compromised, no charges or problems will arise.**

You can check where a given credential is used by searching the code for the
name of the environment variable that holds it.

# Deploying the app

The live version of this app is deployed on Azure, via the terraform definitions
in [azure/main.tf](azure/main.tf).

You can also deploy locally, details below.

Either way, you will need an [ArcGIS for Developers
account](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/plans) and API key.
This is a [condition of
use](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder#terms-and-conditions) of the
esri-leaflet-geocoder project; see also the ArcGIS website.

If you are using Google Maps you will need a Google Cloud account with Places
and Maps JavaScript APIs enabled, and an API key.
See <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard>.

NOTE: these API keys are passed to clients, so you must ensure you have
appropriate usage limits configured to avoid being charged in case of misuse.
You may also wish to employ additional security measures e.g. configuring an
allowed redirect URI.

## How to deploy locally

To save on dependency-chasing, a Dockerfile is provided.
Build the image:

```bash
docker build --tag e-treasure-hunt .
```

Run database migrations and create the admin user:

```bash
docker run \
  --user "$EUID":"${GROUPS[0]}" \
  --rm \
  --mount type=bind,source=$PWD,target=/app \
  e-treasure-hunt migrate

docker run \
  --user "$EUID":"${GROUPS[0]}" \
  --interactive \
  --tty \
  --rm \
  --mount type=bind,source=$PWD,target=/app \
  e-treasure-hunt createsuperuser
```

With this setup done you can run the app as below, and should find it in your
browser at <http://localhost:8000>.

```bash
export ARCGIS_API_KEY="<your API key>"
docker run \
  --env ARCGIS_API_KEY \
  --user "$EUID":"${GROUPS[0]}" \
  --rm \
  --mount type=bind,source="$PWD",target=/app \
  --publish 8000:8000 \
  e-treasure-hunt
```

To use Google Maps, you will also need to pass `GM_API_KEY` to this container as
an environment variable.

# Initiating the app

## Create levels

- You can use the content of `dummy_files.zip` as a template.
- `about.json` contains the name and location for the level (the name is
  displayed on the _next_ level page, so can be the location).
  Tolerance is in metres.
- `blurb.txt` contains the description for the level (displayed on the next
  level page).
- `clue.png` is the first image - the dummy file contains a background.
- `hint1.png` - `hint4.png` are the hints, in order.
  - The five images must be in alphabetical order, but otherwise the exact
    filenames are not important.
  - `.png` and `.jpg` are acceptable formats.

## Level upload

Levels can be uploaded either through a REST API, or via the UI.
The REST API is recommended: it gives much better error messages when things go
wrong.

In addition to the playable levels 1 through N, you will need to upload levels 0
and N+1.
You can use the files in `dummy_files.zip`, updating `blurb.txt` at level 0 with
text for the start of the hunt.

It is recommended, prior to attempting upload, that
[level_validation.py](admin_scripts/level_validation.py) be run over the levels.
This will catch numerous formatting problems with the levels before wasting your
time/bandwidth on server upload, and will also catch several conditions that are
not technically errors but are undesirable, such as empty `README.md` files and
too-tight tolerances.

### Level upload through the API

[upload.py](admin_scripts/upload.py) contains utilities for uploading levels and
hints.

You'll need to update the `SERVER` and credentials at the top of the file, and
then re-arrange `main()` as appropriate to upload your levels.

### Level upload through the UI

This can be done at /mgmt and should be self-explanatory.

### Troubleshooting

The server is not very helpful if you don't get things just right, especially
via the UI.

- You really do need to upload both the dummy levels 0 and N+1.
- If level upload is failing:
  - Make sure that you are uploading exactly one `.txt` file, one `.json` file
    and five images.
  - Make sure that the contents of the JSON file describing the level match the
    example `about.json`.

## Create users

- Add User objects via /admin.
- Pass usernames and passwords to the teams and they can begin the hunt!
